# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project uses AWS SageMaker, and earlier the mini-project does Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost.

For the actual project and instructions, please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
